# Hey there! I'm Ilias Chrysovergis üëã

### VR Developer | Researcher | Entrepreneur | Professional Reality Bender

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where virtual worlds meet real-world impact (and occasionally, where my code actually compiles on the first try).

## About Me

I'm a **Co-Founder & CEO/CTO of Metatopia**, Greece's first Metaverse Studio, where we're building the future one virtual pixel at a time. When I'm not busy convincing people that VR isn't just fancy gaming, I'm a **Lead XR Software Engineer at CERTH** and a **PhD candidate** who's still trying to explain my research to my parents.

My journey started at **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (Electrical & Computer Engineering), took a detour through **Imperial College London** (MSc in Communications & Signal Processing), and somehow landed me in the wonderful world of making impossible things possible through technology.

**Fun fact**: I once built a VR training app during my military service that impressed generals. Turns out, virtual reality and actual reality have more in common than you'd think! üéñÔ∏è

## What I've Been Up To

### üèÜ Microsoft Imagine Cup World Champion (2016)
Led **Team AMANDA** to victory in the World Citizenship Category, winning $50,000 for creating a VR application that tackles school bullying. The app measures empathy levels and helps build understanding through immersive experiences. We even got a **U.S. Patent** for it ‚Äì apparently, changing the world comes with paperwork!

### üöÄ Building the Metaverse (For Real This Time)
**Metatopia** isn't just another metaverse company throwing around buzzwords. We're creating:
- **Digital Twins** that make reality jealous
- **VR Training Platforms** for education and industry
- **Immersive Experiences** for museums and entertainment
- **Simulation Tools** that predict the future (results may vary)

### üî¨ Research That Actually Matters
I publish papers that more than 12 people read (including my mom). Recent work includes:
- **VR and Computer Vision**: Teaching machines to understand surgical procedures in virtual reality
- **Wireless Communications**: Making signals smarter with machine learning
- **COVID-19 Research**: Building smartphone games that boost immune systems (because why not?)

## Technical Superpowers

**The VR/AR/MR Trinity**: I speak fluent Reality ‚Äì all kinds of it
**Machine Learning & AI**: Teaching machines to be almost as smart as humans
**Signal Processing**: Making wireless communication less wireless-less
**Digital Twins**: Creating digital doppelgangers that are actually useful
**Geometric Algebra**: Yes, this is a real thing, and yes, it's as cool as it sounds

**Programming Languages**: I collect them like Pok√©mon cards, but more useful

## Current Adventures

üî¨ **PhD Candidate**: Currently working on research that will either revolutionize VR or provide excellent material for future therapy sessions

üè¢ **Metatopia**: Expanding our metaverse empire across Thessaloniki and Nicosia (world domination comes next)

üì° **CERTH**: Leading XR development and pretending I understand all the research papers I cite

üåä **Urban Water Management**: Building Digital Twins for water systems (because even water needs a virtual version)

*"I solve problems you didn't know you had in ways you don't understand, using technology that shouldn't exist yet."* 

**P.S.**: If you made it this far, you deserve a virtual cookie üç™ (Patent pending)

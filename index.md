# Hey there! I'm Ilias Chrysovergis 👋

### Software Architect & Developer | Researcher | Entrepreneur | Professional Reality Bender

I turn crazy ideas into working code, and somehow people pay me for it.

## About Me

I'm a **Co-Founder & CEO/CTO of Metatopia**, Greece's first Metaverse Studio, where we're building the future one voxel at a time. When I'm not busy convincing people that XR isn't just fancy gaming, I'm a **3D Developer at National Technical University of Athens**, a **Lecturer at Mediterranean College - University of Derby** and a **PhD candidate at University of Thessaly** who's still trying to explain my research to my parents.

My journey started at **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (MEng Electrical & Computer Engineering), took a detour through **Imperial College London** (MSc in Communications & Signal Processing), had a brief but educational stint as a PhD candidate at **University of Cyprus** (turns out academic chemistry matters more than actual chemistry), and somehow landed me in the wonderful world of making technology.

**Fun fact**: I once built a VR training app during my military service that impressed generals. Turns out, virtual reality and actual reality have more in common than you'd think! 🎖️

### 🚀 Current Focus: Building the Metaverse
Co-founder of **Metatopia**, Greece's first Metaverse Studio, where we create digital twins, XR training platforms, and immersive experiences that bridge virtual and real worlds.

### 🔬 Research & Innovation
PhD candidate working on metaverse technologies for wireless systems, published researcher in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, signal processing, and wireless communications, with a focus on making technology more human-centered.

## Technical Superpowers

**The VR/AR/MR Trinity**: I speak fluent Reality – all kinds of it

**Artificial Intelligence**: Teaching machines to be almost as smart as humans

**Signal Processing**: Turning noise into meaningful data (the digital equivalent of finding signal in the chaos)

**Digital Twins**: Creating digital doppelgangers that are actually useful

**Geometric Algebra**: Yes, this is a real thing, and yes, it's as cool as it sounds

**Programming Languages**: Fluent in multiple dialects of computer conversation

## What's Next

🚀 **Expanding Metatopia** across Greece and Cyprus while advancing cutting-edge XR research

🎯 **Always looking for** collaborations that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology

## Let's Connect!

Interested in collaborating on the next big thing in XR? Want to discuss the finer points of wireless communications? Or maybe you just want to ask how team AMANDA convinced judges that a VR/AR anti-bullying app was worth $50,000 in 2016?

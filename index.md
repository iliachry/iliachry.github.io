# Hey there! I'm Ilias Chrysovergis üëã

### XR Developer | Researcher | Entrepreneur | Professional Reality Bender

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where virtual worlds meet real-world impact (and occasionally, where my code actually compiles on the first try).

## About Me

I'm a **Co-Founder & CEO/CTO of Metatopia**, Greece's first Metaverse Studio, where we're building the future one virtual pixel at a time. When I'm not busy convincing people that VR isn't just fancy gaming, I'm a **Lead XR Software Engineer at CERTH** and a **PhD candidate** who's still trying to explain my research to my parents.

My journey started at **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** (MEng Electrical & Computer Engineering), took a detour through **Imperial College London** (MSc in Communications & Signal Processing), and somehow landed me in the wonderful world of making impossible things possible through technology.

**Fun fact**: I once built a VR training app during my military service that impressed generals. Turns out, virtual reality and actual reality have more in common than you'd think! üéñÔ∏è

## What I've Been Up To

### üèÜ Microsoft Imagine Cup World Champion (2016)

### üöÄ Current Focus: Building the Metaverse
Co-founder of **Metatopia**, Greece's first Metaverse Studio, where we create digital twins, VR training platforms, and immersive experiences that bridge virtual and real worlds.

### üî¨ Research & Innovation
PhD candidate working on VR/AR technologies, published researcher in computer vision and wireless communications, with a focus on making technology more human-centered.

## Technical Superpowers

**The VR/AR/MR Trinity**: I speak fluent Reality ‚Äì all kinds of it
**Machine Learning & AI**: Teaching machines to be almost as smart as humans
**Signal Processing**: Making wireless communication less wireless-less
**Digital Twins**: Creating digital doppelgangers that are actually useful
**Geometric Algebra**: Yes, this is a real thing, and yes, it's as cool as it sounds

**Programming Languages**: I collect them like Pok√©mon cards, but more useful

## What's Next

üöÄ **Expanding Metatopia** across Greece and Cyprus while advancing cutting-edge VR research

üéØ **Always looking for** collaborations that push the boundaries of what's possible with immersive technology

Interested in collaborating on the next big thing in VR? Want to discuss the finer points of wireless communications? Or maybe you just want to ask how team AMANDA convinced judges that a VR anti-bullying app was worth $50,000 in 2016?

**P.S.**: If you made it this far, you've officially spent more time reading this page than I spent building the whole website (which is saying something) üêõ

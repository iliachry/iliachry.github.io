# About Me

## The Journey So Far

I'm **Ilias Chrysovergis**, a technology entrepreneur and researcher who believes the most interesting problems are the ones everyone says are impossible to solve. My journey has taken me from winning international competitions to building Greece's first Metaverse Studio, all while pursuing cutting-edge research in VR and wireless communications.

## Education & Background

### üéì Academic Foundation
- **MSc in Communications & Signal Processing** - Imperial College London  
- **Electrical & Computer Engineering** (Honors) - Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)
- **Currently: PhD Candidate** - Advancing VR/AR technologies

### üèÜ Recognition & Awards
- **Microsoft Imagine Cup World Champion 2016** - 1st Place, World Citizenship Category ($50,000)
- **Multiple Excellence Awards** from AUTH Rector (2016, 2017, 2018)
- **U.S. Patent** for innovative VR anti-bullying application
- **Military Innovation Recognition** for VR training systems

## Professional Experience

### **Co-Founder & CEO/CTO - Metatopia** (2023 - Present)
Building Greece's first Metaverse Studio, creating digital twins, VR training platforms, and immersive experiences for industry 4.0, education, and entertainment.

### **Lead XR Software Engineer - CERTH** (Present)
Leading extended reality development projects at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, focusing on cutting-edge VR/AR applications.

### **Research Associate - Urban Water Management** (Present)
Developing Digital Twin solutions for urban water systems, combining my expertise in software engineering with environmental sustainability.

### **Military Service Innovation** (Completed)
Developed VR training applications that earned recognition from high-ranking military officials, proving that virtual reality has real-world military applications.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **human experience** and **emerging technology**. Whether it's creating VR applications that build empathy (like our Microsoft Imagine Cup winner AMANDA), developing digital twins that predict the future, or building metaverse solutions that transform industries, I'm always looking for ways technology can make a meaningful impact.

## Personal Philosophy

*"Technology should enhance human connection, not replace it."*

This belief drives everything I do - from the VR applications I develop to the research I pursue. The goal isn't just to create cool tech, but to solve real problems and improve people's lives.

## Fun Facts

- ‚òï I run on excellent Greek coffee and the occasional deadline-induced adrenaline rush
- üéÆ I once convinced military generals that VR training was revolutionary (spoiler: it was)
- üåä I'm building digital twins for water systems because even H2O deserves a virtual counterpart
- üèõÔ∏è Based between Thessaloniki and Nicosia, bridging Greek innovation with Cypriot collaboration

## Looking Forward

Currently expanding Metatopia across Greece and Cyprus while advancing my PhD research. Always interested in collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with VR, AR, and emerging technologies.

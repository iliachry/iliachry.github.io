# About Me

## The Journey So Far

I'm **Ilias Chrysovergis**, a software architect/developer, researcher, and technology entrepreneur, who believes the most interesting problems are the ones everyone says are impossible to solve. My path has been anything but conventional - from convincing military generals about VR's potential to building empathy-measuring applications that win global competitions.

## Education & Background

### üéì Academic Foundation
- **MEng Electrical & Computer Engineering** (Honors) - Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH)
- **MSc in Communications & Signal Processing** - Imperial College London  
- **Currently: PhD Candidate** - Advancing XR technologies for wireless communications systems

### üèÜ Key Achievements
- **Multiple Excellence Awards** from AUTH Rector (2016, 2017, 2018)
- **U.S. Patent** for innovative VR technology
- **Military Innovation Recognition** for breakthrough VR training systems

## The Story Behind the Tech

### **Early Inspiration**
My fascination with virtual reality started during university when I realized that the most powerful tool for building empathy isn't a speech or a book - it's literally putting someone in another person's shoes. This insight would later drive some of my most impactful work.

### **Military Innovation** 
During my military service, I developed VR training applications that impressed high-ranking officials. Turns out, virtual reality and actual reality have more in common than you'd think! This experience taught me that the best technology solutions come from understanding real-world problems first.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **human experience** and **emerging technology**. Whether it's creating VR applications that build empathy (like our Microsoft Imagine Cup winner AMANDA), developing digital twins that predict the future, or building metaverse solutions that transform industries, I'm always looking for ways technology can make a meaningful impact.

## Personal Philosophy

*"Technology should enhance human connection, not replace it."*

This belief drives everything I do - from the XR applications I develop to the research I pursue. The goal isn't just to create cool tech, but to solve real problems and improve people's lives.

## Fun Facts

- ‚òï I run on Coke Zero, Freddo Espresso, and the occasional deadline-induced adrenaline rush
- üéÆ I once convinced military generals that VR training was revolutionary (spoiler: it was)
- üåä I'm building digital twins for water systems because even H2O deserves a virtual counterpart
- üèõÔ∏è Based in Peraia, Thessaloniki ‚Äì Where I debug code with a view of the Thermaikos Gulf (because even virtual reality needs a real reality backup)

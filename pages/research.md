## üéØ Research Philosophy

**"Technology should solve real problems for real people."**

My research approach combines rigorous academic investigation with practical application. Whether developing VR training systems, optimizing wireless networks, or creating digital twins, the goal is always to bridge the gap between theoretical innovation and measurable impact.

### **Core Principles**:
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The best solutions emerge from combining different fields
- **User-Centered Design**: Technology should enhance human capabilities, not replace them
- **Open Science**: Sharing knowledge accelerates innovation for everyone
- **Practical Impact**: Research should address real-world challenges and opportunities
